## Description:
This thing does, you guessed it, math. The main focus was to practice `React` as well as the CSS `grid system`. This supports digits, wait for it, zero through nine. You need a number negative? Don't worry there's a button for that. There's even a nice decimal for you. You need some operators? We got you subtraction, addition, division, and multiplication. What's, that you need to calculate a percentage? No sweat, we got you. And after you type out all those pretty computations, what do you do? Well we got the answer, that's the equal sign. And after you're all done, guess what we got a nice All Clear button for you (Yes, thats what the AC stands for in a calculator). This calculator practically sweats features. Get it while it's hot.
